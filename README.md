# Orange OS LE Install Script

The name says it all, a install script for the [Orange OS Linux Edition](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/620114/) OS!

## How to Install

If you run Arch OS, then simply install the latest version of python, download this as a zip file, then extract the zip file and do `python3 install.py` in your terminal. The script should take care of the rest. After all of that, you will get Arch Linux as of now. But we are working on making it as close as possible to the Orange OS you saw on Scratch.

If you don't, then I am sorry, but there's no direct support as of now. Just download the arch ISO from [XenonBD (direct download)](http://mirror.xeonbd.com/archlinux/iso/latest/archlinux-x86_64.iso), install a flasher like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) for windows or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) for both Windows and other Linux Distros, then flash the downloaded ISO onto a USB drive and boot from said usb drive. Then refer back to the sentence above.
